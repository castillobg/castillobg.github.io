Recently, in many conversations with different coworkers and colleagues, a subject kept popping up: being great at something specific vs. being good at many things.
A weird, weird monster.
The tech world in its physical form.

My history in the tech world is not a long one. I started my undergraduate studies in only 5 years ago, and have been consciously programming — that is, on serious personal projects and paid work — for 3 years, but that’s long enough to know that before Swift, Java, Go, Ruby or Python, there was C, Smalltalk, ASM in all of its forms, COBOL, among many other languages which served to create the tools we use now. Hell, my dad made programs on punched cards! And that’s only the programming languages chapter. But that’s one of the things I love about the tech world, its ironically organic behavior: great things thrive for a moment. They might help build things atop of them, or are eventually replaced. A lot more other things die trying. It’s hard to keep up with all the updates and changes, but it’s exciting.

But a few days ago, I heard someone say:

    To be a senior developer, you have to have spent at least 10 years using the language!

Of course, I didn’t give it too much importance, because, c’mon. No need to explain. It’s just stupid. But it got me thinking: How many years should you spend using something before you become a senior programmer?

Now, many programming languages have been around long enough for someone — besides their creators / maintainers — to be able to spend 10 years using it non-stop. But the joy I find in programming resides in the idea that it’s an ever evolving monster. Since I started, I’ve created simple programs and software using Python, Java, C#, Javascript, Assembly and Ruby. And, some creations are deeper than others, but I find things in every language that are different from the others. And that wide perspective is something invaluable.

It’s comforting to think that in 2 years from now, new things will pop up in the ever-changing scene, and that I’ll learn new stuff about new stuff. If becoming a senior developer requires that I spend my days using just one programming language, and learning only things about that language, I’d rather be a jack of all trades, and master of some.
